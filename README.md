# Ledger.tmbundle

Ledger.tmbundle is a TextMate bundle for working with [ledger](https://github.com/jwiegley/ledger) documents.

It is a work in progress, but has support for the following functions:

 - Current Balance (Non Virtualized)
 - Current Balance (Virtualized)
 - Net Worth

To activate these commands, use ^âŒ˜L and you'll get a menu to choose the command.

It also has a tab completed Snippet to enter a new ledger entry, `ent`

Make sure that the `ledger` command is located in the PATH shell variable in the TextMate preferences.

Some of these files (Syntaxes and Preferences) were borrowed from [Benjamin Cullen-Kerney](https://github.com/bak/Ledger.tmbundle).
